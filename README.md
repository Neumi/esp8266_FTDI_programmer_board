# esp8266_FTDI_programmer_board
This is my ESP8266 FTDI Programmer Board. Just to share. With reset button.
I just had problems with the programming modes. In this setup the board boots in 1,6 boot mode.
To read out the current boot mode connect this programmer to basic FDTI programmer like this:

And start a serial session with 74880 baud. Reset the ESP8266 with the reset button.



IMPORTANT:
ONLY 3.3v allowed with esp8266 boards. You gonna fry these boards with 5v.
